# Welcome to a Cosmology Trivia Game!

## The following project is Assignment 5 of the UCB Full Stack Coding Bootcamp

### Overview

I employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to make a timed trivia game with the same name. The point of this exercise was to use JavaScript and jQuery logic to generate trivia questions to be answered sequentially within a set amount of time. The player has 15 seconds to answer each question by clicking on the answer to move on to the next, for a total of 10 questions. The game logic relies heavily on the setTimeout and setInterval functions of JavaScript to create deadlines for answering questions, and to move to the next question automatically. 

### Gameplay:

* A cosmology-based question will appear on the screen when the player clicks start.

   * The player will have 15 seconds to choose from 4 options to answer the trivia question.

   * When the player clicks on an answer, the game will alert them whether they answered the question correctly or incorrectly. 

     * 3 seconds after answering the question, the next question will appear automatically and the player will have another 15 seconds to answer that one.

   * The player continues through this process for 10 total questions.

   * At the completion of the game, the player will be shown their results (correctly/incorrectly answered questions).

   * The player will be given the option to play again after completing a full game by clicking a restart button.

 I employed the use of ---. I then outputted the response to a Bootstrap Jumbotron-style div container to act as the User Interface for the game. The code snippet below shows how to display new trivia questions with a timer and alert the player upon clicking an answer whether they answered correctly or incorrectly:

 ``` javascript

 ```
